# GUICalculator

This program was a project from my 305 'Coding Practicum' course from the University of Washington. It is my first GUI project and functions as a 
decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and scientific calculator. This project taught me a lot about working with interfaces and abstract classes in Java, and 
I enjoyed learning how to implement GUIs through this project.
